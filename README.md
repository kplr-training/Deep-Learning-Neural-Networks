# Neural Networks

### What is a dense neural network ?  
Layers are fully connected (dense) by the neurons in a network layer.  
Each neuron in a layer receives an input from all the neurons present in the previous layer. 
Thus, theyâ€™re densely connected.

The learning process is described simply as minimizing a loss function
